            <h1>Claire Wang</h1>
            <p>I'm a second year data science student at UCSD who is passionate about 
                using data science to benefit society. I also want to learn about how data 
                science can be used in scientific fields to aid with research and analysis. 
                I'm a curious person and I love learning!</p>
